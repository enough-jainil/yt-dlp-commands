Preview: [YT-DLP Command Generator](https://toolbrew.org/)

## Why I Built This

As someone who frequently downloads videos, I got tired of constantly checking documentation and remembering complex command-line flags for yt-dlp. This tool is essentially my personal cheat sheet that I'm sharing with others who might find it useful.

## What Is This?

A comprehensive web interface that helps you generate yt-dlp commands without memorizing every single flag and option. Think of it as a "command builder" that makes downloading videos, audio, and other content easier.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸŽ¥ Download videos from various platforms
- ðŸŽµ Extract audio with preset quality settings
- ðŸ“‹ Generate commands quickly with validation
- ðŸ›  Handle complex download scenarios
- ðŸŽ¯ **NEW: Preset Aliases** - Quick access to common configurations:
  - **MP3**: Extract audio in MP3 format with best quality
  - **AAC**: Extract audio in AAC format with best quality
  - **MP4**: Download video in MP4 format with H.264 codec
  - **MKV**: Download video in MKV container format
  - **Sleep**: Add delays between requests to avoid rate limiting
- ðŸ”§ **Advanced Options**: Support for format sorting, impersonation, geo-restriction bypass
- âœ… **Smart Validation**: Real-time validation with incompatibility detection
- ðŸŽ¨ **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with dark/light theme support

## How It Works

1. Choose what you want to do (download video, extract audio, etc.)
2. **Quick Start**: Use preset aliases for common tasks:
   - Click "Apply" next to **MP3** for instant audio extraction setup
   - Click "Apply" next to **MP4** for video download with optimal settings
   - Use **Sleep** preset when downloading many files to avoid rate limits
3. **Advanced**: Select individual options for custom configurations
4. Get your complete yt-dlp command instantly with real-time validation

## ðŸŽ¯ Using Preset Aliases

The preset aliases correspond to yt-dlp's built-in `--preset-alias` / `-t` option:

```bash
# These presets are equivalent to:
yt-dlp -t mp3 [URL]    # MP3 preset
yt-dlp -t aac [URL]    # AAC preset
yt-dlp -t mp4 [URL]    # MP4 preset
yt-dlp -t mkv [URL]    # MKV preset
yt-dlp -t sleep [URL]  # Sleep preset
```
